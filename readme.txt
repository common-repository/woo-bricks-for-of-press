Enables Drag and Drop Layout for WooCommerce Pages while using the OF Press Theme.

== Description ==

Only WooCommerce 2.x and above is supported.

This plugin will free you of having to simply accept the layout limitations imposed by the popular WooCommerce plugin.

Don't want to hack PHP override templates just to get your product pages look right? Don't worry, you no longer have to.

It may also end up making unnecessary some of the otherwise expensive add-on plugins you'd have to license annually just to fix some of these layout issues.

== Installation ==

1. Login to your WP Dashboard
2. Select Plugins -> Add New
3. Either search WooBricks or click Upload and specify the (downloaded) file ofb-woo-bricks.zip
4. Once installed, simply activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the WooBricks after plugin activation? =

You should find that a new "WooCommerce" tab has been added to the usual Layout Builder metabox area.

= Why isn't the WooBricks Tab there? =

Make sure you've installed and activated the required supporting plugin WooCommerce v2.x or later as well.

= Why don't the bricks output anything on the front end? =

Ensure the "Content Area for Single Post" Theme Option has been set correctly in the OF Press theme Options.
Then verify you've only used them with WooCommerce pages. They're not designed to work anywhere else.

= Why isn't there a X WooBrick provided? =

It may be because you've simply not suggested it yet.

If that's not it, it may be because the a brick in the standard set of "Bricks" tab makes it redundant.

Example: The standard "Post Title" brick included with OF Press work just fine on WooCommerce pages. You can use it to display a Product's Title if you wish.
